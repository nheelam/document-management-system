# document-management-system
A Natural Language Processing project to develop a Document Management System using Named Entity Recognition (NER)

# 1. Introduction
A Document Management System (DMS) streamlines the hiring process by managing, organizing, and storing resumes and CVs, helping hiring teams save time and reduce recruitment costs. However, manually classifying and analyzing resumes is time-consuming and error-prone. Companies employ DMS to automate the extraction of relevant information using Named Entity Recognition (NER) from resumes in PDF format, enabling efficient categorization based on entities such as education, designation, skills, and country. This enhances the hiring process, improves data tracking, and enables better decision-making for hiring teams.

# 2. Objective
(i) To build a DMS system that is integrated with NER model that can recognize the following entities which are college name, companies worked at, degree, designation, email address, graduation year, location, name, skills and years of experience. <br>
(ii) To allow user to add resumes to the Document Management System <br>
(iii) To allow users to search and retrieve resumes based on certain entities. <br>
